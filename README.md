# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to the Python Projects Repository!

This repository contains a collection of basic Python projects that I have worked on. These projects are designed to help beginners get hands-on experience with Python and understand the fundamental concepts of programming.

## Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder with the necessary Python files. Most projects are self-contained and do not require additional dependencies, but if needed, the required packages will be mentioned in the project's README or the code itself.
